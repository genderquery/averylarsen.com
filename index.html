<h1>Hello! My name is Avery.</h1>

<p>
  This site exists mostly to document things I learned so I can reference them
  in the future. It looks like this on purpose.
</p>

<h2>Read something I wrote recently</h2>

<ol reversed class="post-list">
  {%- for post in collections.posts reversed -%}
  <li>
    <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.data.title }}</a>
  </li>
  {%- endfor -%}
</ol>
